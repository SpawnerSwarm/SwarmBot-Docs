Welcome to the Deadly Runners Division!

This is a display of this clan's best builds, submitted by a wide array of clan members.  Each build provides a title to each individual.  
For a screenshot of a riven, click <:riven:439450118870269954>.
Click :id: to recieve the identification of the build via pm.
The order of information on the top of the build goes as follows: build name, weapon/warframe name, mastery holder.

**Submission Process**
For specifics on what is and is not allowed in build submissions, use:
`!help deadlyrunners`
Submissions are to be private messaged to <@156962731084349442>, who will determine if the submitted build is objectively better than the previous build.  If so, your build will be posted, and  you will be awarded the mastery title for the build, and the previous build will be archived.
