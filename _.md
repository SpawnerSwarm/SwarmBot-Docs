**Wiki Linking**

You can link wiki pages from Warframe, Dark Souls (1, 2, and 3), Path of Exile, Spiral Knights, and Hearthstone using the bot with the following syntax:
    
    [[Article]]

That would link to the Warframe wiki page for 'Article' since Warframe is the default wiki. To link something from the Spiral Knights wiki, use the prefix:

    sk[[Article]]

You can view a full list of the prefixes at https://to.crunchyintheory.com/wiki-prefixes.
