----------------------------------------------What we do----------------------------------------------------------Deadly Runners is a division of the Spawner Swarm that takes the game Warframe to its theoretical limits.  An individual who wishes to take part in the division will volunteer for one weapon and come up with builds to max out every single stat type for that weapon.  The builds will then be posted to #finalizedbuilds by Zealous_Vindictor to publicize the build.  Please ask Zealous_Vindictor to participate if you wish to do so. To update a build, you need to supply proof that your build is better then the already-established build.  Warframes will be judged by how effective they are at what they are specifically built for.  Therefore, when you send a Warframe build, please specify what it is built for.  Also, Warframe builder is only allowed for Lato Prime, Skana Prime, and Excalibur Prime.  Anything else requires a Warframe screenshot.  Your mods must be exactly what a max build needs.  Failure to do this will  let others take your build with maxed mods, so please max your mods.

-----------------------------------------------Titles-------------------------------------------------------------
Title of "(Weapon Name Volunteered for) Master" will be awarded to the person who creates and maintains the maxed out weapon builds that the given individual has volunteered for.  It will not be revoked if the person decides to leave, however the list of available weapons will be updated to allow another master to arise.

----------------------------------------------Riven Rules---------------------------------------------------------
Rivens are allowed in builds, however, the title of "(Weapon Name Volunteered for) Master" will be altered to "Riven (Weapon Name Volunteered for) Master" to indicate a seperation in build types.
